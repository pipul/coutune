Where to find complete HPDB documentation?
-------------------------------------------

This README is just a fast "quick start" document. You can find more
detailed documentation at http://pipul.org

Building HPDB library
---------------------

It is as simple as:

    % make

After building libdb.a is a good idea to test it, using:

    % make db-bench
    % ./db-bench <database path> <write | delete | read> count

NOTE: now HPDB just support 32bit linux/unix system.

ENJOY!
